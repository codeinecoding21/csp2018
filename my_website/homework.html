					<h2>Second Day Scratch Project</h2>
			<a target = "_blank" href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/200050492/">
			   <img src="images/scratch.JPG" height = "300"></a>
			   <br>
			   <p>Click on the preview to play our Scratch game. A dad must find his son by <br>going through various obstacle and mazes before his
			   mom finds out.</p>
		
		<h2>App Inventor</h2>
			<img src="images/phyapp.PNG" height = "300">
			<img src="images/qrapp.PNG" height = "300">
			<br>
			<p>Scan QR Code to install our physics calculator. This is a calculator that provides specific<br>
			physics equations. Plug in your values for each variable and get the right answer to <br>your physics homework.</p>
		
		<h2>Python Flowchart</h2>
			<a target = "_blank" href = "https://repl.it/@PhapPham/SquareMelodicEditors">
			   <img src="images/sword.jpg" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/flowchart.JPG" height = "300"></a>
			   <br>
			   <p>Based on the flowchart we create din class, we created a simulation of a quest to find treasure. <br>You must make all the right decisions
			   in order to advance through the flowchart and succeed in finding the treasure. Click on swordsman to begin<br> the simulation.
		
		<h2>Python Project</h2>
			<a target = "_blank" href = "Project.py">
			   <img src="images/python.png" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/password.png" height = "300"></a>
			   <br>
			   <p>This project was created in order to check if a certain password is secure and safe. If the password doesn't meet <br>
			   the certain requirements, then a randomly generated password that is secure will be offered as an alternative.</p>
		<h2>Image Artist</h2>
			   <img src="images/Tpose.jpg" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/tpose2.PNG" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/codetpose.PNG" height = "300">
			   <br>
			   <p>In this project, we chose any image and used a simple algorithm to alter that image in a different way.<br> The image's 
			   colors that were between a certain assigned spectrum were changed to a lime green, which changed the original image.</p>
		<h2>GUI Project</h2>
			   <img src="images/guiproj.PNG" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/guiproj1.PNG" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/guiproj2.PNG" height = "300">
			   <br>
			   <p>In this project, we chose any image and manipulated it by coding a GUI. The GUI allows a certain image to be <br> manipulated in certain ways.
			For example, the size, angle, pattern, and structure of the cow image I chose can be constantly changed for different outcomes.</p>
		<h2>Python Graph</h2>
			   <img src="images/finalgrpah.PNG" height = "300">
			   <img src="images/codegraph.PNG" height = "300">
			   
			   <br>
			   <p>In this project, took a specific set of data off the internet on the number of deaths caused by natural disasters by year.  <br> The data 
			was then put through python code that reads the data and transforms it into a scatterplot, making the data easier<br>
			and more efficient to read. The y-axis is the number of deaths and the x-axis is the number of years from 1980. The question answered<br>
			by the graph is whether or not the number decreased due to better preparation throughout the years</p>
		<h2>NetLogo Simulation</h2>
			   <img src="images/modify1.PNG" height = "500">
			   <img src="images/modify2.PNG" height = "500">
			<br>
			   <img src="images/modify3.PNG" height = "500">
			   
			   <br>
			   <p>For this project, we browsed many simulations of different types of scenarios. This example answers the question of how<br> 
			turtles climb hills or descend into valleys using the uphill, uphill4, downhill, and downhill4 commands.<br>
			The same technique is useful for modeling any kind of creature that follows a gradient in its environment. <br>
			I then modified the code to change the background color, the magnitude and direction at which the turtles climb, and the color <br>
			of the demonstrating lines (red to blue) </p>
